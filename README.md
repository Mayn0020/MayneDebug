MayneDebug
==========

This is a Unity3d HTML debug log tool. It's used to export a log file to an external HTML file. This system allows you to put your logs in catagories that you can then filter by in HTML. This is currently in the first pass and is not full functional. 

Feature to come
---------------
1) Debug Graph. Log a value over a graph.
2) Debug Stack Trace. Find out what currently was happening in the Stack.
3) More to come.
